3. Traffic Pattern Analysis
-------------------------
Distinguishing Features by Application Type:

Web Browsing:
- Characterized by variable packet sizes
- Heavy use of TLS/HTTPS (port 443)
- Bursty traffic patterns
- Irregular intervals between packets

Video Conferencing:
- Consistent, regular packet intervals
- High presence of UDP and DTLS
- STUN protocol for NAT traversal
- Bidirectional traffic with similar patterns

Streaming:
- Larger average packet sizes
- Sustained traffic patterns
- Heavy use of TCP and QUIC protocols
- More downstream than upstream traffic

4. Security Implications
----------------------
Application Fingerprinting:
- Different applications show distinct traffic patterns
- Video conferencing can be identified by STUN/DTLS usage
- Streaming services show consistent large packet patterns
- Web browsing shows varied packet sizes and intervals

Privacy Considerations:
- Even with encryption, traffic patterns can reveal application usage
- Packet timing and size can indicate user activity
- Protocol usage can identify specific applications
- Regular patterns in video calls can reveal meeting duration
- Streaming patterns can indicate quality of content (HD vs SD)
